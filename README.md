## Web-Development
The first thing I am learning right now is web-development with [flask](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework.
1. Create a AWS account as it offers 12-months free tier.
2. Having VSCode installed with remote SSH extension -- (tutorial available on request)
3. Setup a VSCode remote SSH to the AWS EC2 instance (Free Server, Yeah!!!). [Flask-Setup-In-AWS(1).md](https://github.com/AndyOverLord/Hello-world/blob/master/Flask-Setup-In-AWS(1).md)
4. Setup flask framework on AWS and configure the development enrivonment using AWS SG. [Flask-Setup-In-AWS(2)](https://github.com/AndyOverLord/Hello-world/blob/master/Flask-Setup-In-AWS(2).md)
